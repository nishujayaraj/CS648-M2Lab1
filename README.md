percentOf(): Calculate the percentage the first number represents of the second (e.g., "2 is 50% of 4").<br>
findModulus(): Find the modulus of two numbers (e.g., "2 is the modulus of 4 and 10").

## ```02-rock-paper-scissors.js:```  
The user chooses rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects one of the options. <br>
